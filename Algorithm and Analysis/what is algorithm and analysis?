//Algorithim//

    An algorithm is a well-defined computational procedure that takes some values as input and produces some values as output. It is a step-by-step method of solving a problem or manipulating data


//Analysis//

Algorithm analysis provides an estimation of the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem. It determines the amount of time and space resources required to execute an algorithm
